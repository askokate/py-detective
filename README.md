Implementation of a program to search for occurrences of regular expressions
within a directory tree (a little like 'grep' and a little like 'find').
Output will simply be the relative path to all files in the directory
(or tree) whose name (or content) matches the regex filter.

Usage: python detective.py [options] <path> <regex>
